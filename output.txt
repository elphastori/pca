Principal Component 1
94.3948%

Principal Component 2
5.60516%

The eigenvalue of each principal component was used to calculate the percentage.
The eigenvector with the larger percentage has a higher spread, the data varies 
most in its direction.

The purpose of Principal Component Analysis is to identify these directions in 
which the data varies most.
